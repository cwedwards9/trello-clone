Trellolo is a simple clone of the Kanban-style project management tool, Trello. Users can create an account and from there can create "Boards" to manage their projects. Within a Board, a user can create "Lists" to place their "Cards" in. Cards are tasks to be done for the project. Users can use the drag and drop feature to easily move and update Cards to different Lists.
